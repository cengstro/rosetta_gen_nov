In the event of discrepancy between the shared Google Drive and this directory (Casey's ownCLoud), this directory contains the most up to date data (this is where I download from Genewiz, and do the Seqtrace QC)

if one genewiz sequencing batch (eg CE_123456789) has just one of two paired end reads, the .str in the more recent batch will additionally contain the other paired read from the older batch
